# Fraud Detection Application for Real-time Credit Card Transactions
 
**Dataset**: [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection)

The dataset we are going to use describes the features of  online transactions made by  credit/debit cards. The data is broken into two files: identity and transaction, which are joined by TransactionID.  The identity file describes the features of a transaction, like: time, amount, product, address, and etc.. The identity file stores records for network connection information (IP, ISP, Proxy, etc) and digital signature associated with transactions.
 
The dataset is provided by Vesta Corporation, which is the forerunner in guaranteed e-commerce payment solutions. And can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview).
 
## Project Description:
![title](./assets/structure.png)

Our capstone project focuses on building a full-stack fraud detection application from end to end. The detection engine will predict real-time credit card transactions and make a low-latency prediction. This project explores the connections between different stages throughout a data science project including data collection, preprocessing, modeling, and model deployment. Moreover, we are planning to integrate the fraud prediction product with web application development and provide a web-based interactive console to manage the whole pipeline.
